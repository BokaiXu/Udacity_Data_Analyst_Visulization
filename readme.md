# Explore Flight Delay Time of BOS and SFO in 2019
## by Bokai Xu


## Dataset

> This data set contains the flights delay reason and delay time of BOS and SFO from Jan. 2019 to Dec. 2019.


## Summary of Findings

>  I made a boxplot that compares the average flight delay time between BOS and SFO monthly. It shows the average flight delay time of BOS and SFO are similar alghough in June and September there is some major difference. Then I plot the average flight delay time and the time of filght delay monthly, it is clear to see a positive relation.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> First I want to see whether the average flight delay time was distributed brodaly(like from 1 minute to several hours), I plot the histogram of average flight delay time and it turns out the time is not very distributed.
Then I want to know whether the average flight delay time of each month of 2019 in BOS and SFO was distributed similarly, so I plot the histogram of average delay flight time monthly and it turns out the delay time lie mainly in 20 to 100 minutes.
Then I used boxplot to compare the difference of average flight delay time in BOS and SFO monthly. The result is these airports have similar delay flight time except for June and September.
Finally I plot the average flight delay time and the time of flight delay to find out whether there is a positive relation. It is reasonable to say with more delay flights the time need to wait will be longer. And the plots suggest this idea might be true.
